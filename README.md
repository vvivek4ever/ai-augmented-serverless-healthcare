# AI-Augmented, Cloud-Agnostic Serverless Healthcare Framework

Artifacts for the paper *"AI-Augmented, Cloud-Agnostic Serverless Framework for Intelligent Infectious Disease Response in Healthcare"*.

This repository contains **synthetic datasets**, **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates**, and **example AI/ML stubs** to help reproduce the concepts and experiments described in the paper.

## 📂 Contents

### `synthetic-data/`
Script to generate privacy-safe synthetic healthcare datasets:
- `health_events.csv` – Simulated daily test outcomes, vaccination flags, and exposure scores.
- `contact_edges.csv` – Example contact network for graph analytics.

### `iac/`
Multi-cloud Infrastructure-as-Code templates:
- AWS Terraform stub for Lambda-based inference.
- Knative manifest for Kubernetes-native deployment.

### `src/`
Minimal inference API stub for serverless environments.

### `notebooks/`
Example AI/ML workflows (to be expanded).

### `.github/workflows/`
CI pipeline to test synthetic data generation.

## 📜 Reproducibility

The operational dataset used in our deployment is **not public** due to HIPAA/GDPR requirements.  
This repo provides:
- Synthetic data with similar statistical characteristics to public WHO/CDC statistics.
- Minimal IaC templates to replicate multi-cloud serverless deployment patterns.
